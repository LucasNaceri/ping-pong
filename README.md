# ping-pong
This is a ping pong score keeper made with AngularJS, an MVVM architecture. 

Play with it live here: http://jennyknuth.github.io/ping-pong/

This was quick and easy to make with one div, one controller, and a few logical directives. 

Similar in style and design philosophy to my minimalist tic-tac-toe game using vanilla JavaScript found here: https://github.com/jennyknuth/tic-tac-toe
